Using LEFT OUTER JOINS

We have a table with rows for each document with it's title, content, and author. First, we used UPDATE to change the author to 'Jackie Draper' for all rows where it's currently 'Jackie Paper'. Then re-select all the rows to make sure the table changed the way we wanted.
Now we want to delete one particular row where the title is 'Things I'm Afraid Of'. Then we re-select all the rows to make sure the table changed like we wanted.
